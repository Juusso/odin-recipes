        <p>Remember when you were a kid and a "bad day" was getting friction burn while going down the playground slide too fast? You'd cry and get an adults attention who would then immediately take you into the office, pour some rubbing alcohol on the burn followed by a bandaid?</p>
        <p>Those were the good ol days; days when you didn't have any responsibility and were allowed to breakdown and give up for the time being while an adult took care of you. That doesn't happen anymore, but that doesn't mean you can't revert to a child-like state after a long day by making some delicious homemade lasagna just like grandpappy used to make.</p>
        <p>Temporarily escape from the present and sit in blissful ignorance as the taste of this delicious lasagna takes you down nastalgia lane.</p>
