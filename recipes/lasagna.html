        <p>Remember when you were a kid and a "bad day" was getting friction burn while going down the playground slide too fast? You'd cry and get an adults attention who would then immediately take you into the office, pour some rubbing alcohol on the burn followed by a bandaid?</p>
        <p>Those were the good ol days; days when you didn't have any responsibility and were allowed to breakdown and give up for the time being while an adult took care of you. That doesn't happen anymore, but that doesn't mean you can't revert to a child-like state after a long day by making some delicious homemade lasagna just like grandpappy used to make.</p>
        <p>Temporarily escape from the present and sit in blissful ignorance as the taste of this delicious lasagna takes you down memory lane.</p>

    <h2>How to Make Lasagna</h2>

            <p>Homemade lasagna may have a few steps, but each step is easy – and I assure you it’s worth the time; the perfect Italian meal!</p>
            <p>The ingredients in this recipe are all things you know and it’s not difficult at all! All you’ll need for this easy lasagna recipe is one pan, one bowl, and a 9×13 baking dish!</p>
            <p>A quick overview of the layers:</p>   
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Cheese Filling</strong>Mix the ricotta and cheeses (per recipe below) with an egg in a bowl, and set aside. No ricotta? No problem, cottage cheese works just fine in this recipe!</li>
                    <li><strong>Meat Sauce</strong>Brown the onion, garlic, and meat in a pot on the stovetop. Add the pasta sauce and tomato paste & simmer a few minutes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Layer Together</strong>Layer the meat sauce and cheese mixture with noodles and bake until bubbling</li>
                </ul>
            
        <h2>Spinach Lasagna</h2>

                <p>To make a spinach lasagna, squeeze out most of the moisture of defrosted frozen spinach and add it along with the cheese layer. Lasagna ingredients don’t have to be limited to the ones you see here.</p>
                <p>Substitute meats or different cheeses, or tru different <a href="https://www.spendwithpennies.com/easy-meat-sauce/">meat sauce</a> variations</p>

        <h2>How to Layer Lasagna</h2>    
                
                <p>Once you have prepared the meat sauce and cheeses you're ready to layer. This is the order of layers:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Sauce - noodles - cheese</li>
                        <li>Sauce - noodles - cheese</li>

                        <li>Noodles - sauce (bake) - cheese</li>
                    </ul>
                  
                <div class = 'firstlist'>
                    <ol>

                    <p>We love serving a classic lasagna dinner, complete with a <a href="https://www.spendwithpennies.com/caesar-salad/">caesar salad</a> or italian salad and <a hred="https://www.spendwithpennies.com/30-minute-dinner-rolls/">dinner rolls</a> slatherd in <a href="spendwithpennies.com/best-homemade-garlic-butter/">homemade garlic butter</a>.It's the world's best meal!</p>


        <h2>Make Ahead</h2>
                    <p>Lasagna can be prepared ahead of time and refrigerated up to 2 days before baking. It can also be frozen before or after baking.</p>
                        
        <h2>To Freeze</h2>
                    <p>Lasagna is one of the best meals to make ahead and freeze. Double or triple the recipe and freeze some for anothe day, Defrost in the refrigerator overnight and bake as directed.</p>
                   
        <h2>To reheat Lasagna</h2>
                    <p>If you've frozen leftovers, pop them in the oven at 350F covered, until reheated. This should take about 30 minsutes! Ofcourse, leftovers are perfectly heated in the microwave too!</p>

        <h2>Recipe Notes</h2>
                    <p>*Note on the sauce: In this recipe each layer has about 1 cup of meat sauce. If you prefer more sauce in your lasagna, increase the pasta sauce to 48 oz.</p>
                    <p><strong>Time Saving Tip:</strong>Use fresh lasagna sheets found in the deli area and skip the boiling step! Fresh lasagna doesn't need to be boiled first.</p>
                    <p>Let the lasagna sit/rest for at least 15 minutes once removed from the oven (even 30-45 minutes is fine). This will keep it from becoming runny and help it to keep its shape when cut.</p>
                    <p>Resting is not required when reheating.</p>
                    <p><strong>Substitutions:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Ricotta cheese can be replaced with cottage cheese.</li>
                            <li>Use all beef (or even ground turkey) in place of sausage if needed.</li>
                        </ul>
